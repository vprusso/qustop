Distinguishing Quantum States via Separable Measurements
========================================================

As previously mentioned, optimizing over the set of separable measurements is
NP-hard. However, there does exist a hierarchy of semidefinite programs which
eventually does converge to the separable value. This hierarchy is based off
the notion of symmetric extensions. More information about this hierarchy of
SDPs can be found here [Nav08]_.
