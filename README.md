# qustop

qustop (QUantum STate OPtimizer) is a Python toolkit for studying various
quantum state optimization scenarios including calculating optimal values for
quantum state distinguishability, quantum state exclusion, quantum state
cloning, and more.

## Installation

## The setting

The `qustop` package is 

# ![qsd](./docs/figures/quantum_state_distinguish.svg "qsd") 

1. Alice possesses an ensemble of `n` quantum states:
```
    eta = ((p_0, rho_0), ..., (p_n, rho_n))
```
where `p_i` is the probability with which `rho_i` is selected from the ensemble. 
Alice picks `rho_i` with probability `p_i` from her ensemble and sends `rho_i` to Bob.
